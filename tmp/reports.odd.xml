               <head>Editing in oXygen</head>
               <p>All work on the reports should be done in oXygen. It is an
    incredibly powerful and useful tool for editing XML &amp; XHTML and
    there are a number of custom features and tools that will editing
    easier and more efficient.</p>
               <p>When you open oXygen, make sure you see the
    <code>reports.xpr</code> project in the oXygen project
    pane (usually on the left-hand side):</p>
               <p>
                  <figure>
                     <figDesc>Project pane</figDesc>
                     <graphic url="images/oxygen_splash.png"/>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>oXygen remembers the last project you opened, so it will usually
    use the <code>wilde-reports</code> project file
    automatically. If, for whatever reason, you are not in the
    <code>wilde-reports</code> project, make sure to open the
    project file by going to <code>Project/Open Project</code>
    in the toolbar. You can use the Project pane to navigate through the
    project files; all of the HTML files are in the
    <code>reports/</code> folder.</p>
               <p>On your system, the folder may be called something else in oXygen
    (wilde-reports is pretty likely).
    This is normal and expected. Besides, "reports" is a
    terrible name. It has been around for so long we cannot really
    change it anymore.</p>
               <p>As you edit the HTML files in oXygen, it is imperative that you
    frequently and consistently validate your file. Invalidities in an
    oXygen are signalled much like spell-check: the invalid element is
    underlined in red and its location in the document is marked in the
    scrollbar.</p>
               <p>oXygen validates for you automatically as you type, but it might
    lag (especially for large or complex documents), so it is best
    practice to trigger validation manually as well, especially before
    committing your changes.</p>
               <p>To validate your document, you can either use the keyboard
    shortcut CMD+Shift+V (CMD = ⌘ on Mac) or click the red checkmark in
    the toolbar:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure>
                     <figDesc>Validate</figDesc>
                     <graphic url="images/oxygen_validation_valid.png"/>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Once the document finishes validating, there will be a message at
    the bottom of the screen stating whether validation was successful.
    If there are errors in your document and validation fails, you will
    see the red underlines and a info box at the bottom of the screen
    that outlines the precise errors.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure>
                     <figDesc>Validation errors</figDesc>
                     <graphic url="images/oxygen_validation_errors.png"/>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Try your best to determine what the error is: the validation
    message usually provides a good indication of what the error is
    (some are more helpful than others); the problem is quite often
    something simple like a typo, an errant space at the beginning or
    end of an element, or a missing quotation mark.</p>
               <p>If you can't figure out the error, then it is OK to commit the
    file, but do let the team and the developers know right away so that
    the error can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>If you find an error message that is very unhelpful, and can
    think of better wording to make the error and appropriate resolution
    clear, please file a
    <ref target="https://github.com/sfu-dhil/wilde-schema/issues">GitHub Issue</ref> and provide an example of the error and suggested
    improvement.</p>

               <head>Cleaning Up Old Reports</head>
               <p>The guidelines for creating and editing reports have changed over
    time. The reports should have been updated to the most recent
    guidelines, but you may find some reports that have tags that we no
    longer use, or tags that are generated as part of the text
    processing.</p>
               <p>We have automated as much of the clean up as possible. To clean
    this cruft from your document, you can either use the keyboard
    shortcut CMD+Shift+T (CMD = ⌘ on Mac) or click the red play icon in
    the toolbar (which oXygen unhelpfully calls
    Apply Transformation
    Scenario).</p>

               <head>Committing Changes</head>
               <p>After you've made a set of changes (i.e. before you take a break
    or before the end of your work day) and confirmed that they were
    valid, you need to commit those changes to the repository. To do
    that, navigate to GitHub Desktop, which should show you a list of
    changes that you've made: <figure>
                     <figDesc>Changes</figDesc>
                     <graphic url="images/changes.png"/>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>It is a good idea to review those changes to make sure everything
    looks right (i.e. all of the files that you actually changed are
    listed; there are no additional changes). (You may see that the
    <code>reports.xpr</code> oXygen project file has changed
    even though you didn't do anything to it—that's expected).</p>
               <p>Assuming that everything looks correct, you can then commit those
    files by filling out the commit message boxes in the bottom
    left-hand corner.</p>
               <p>These commit messages are helpful for record keeping and for
    tracking changes to the files; note that these commit messages are
    both permanent and public. In the <code>Summary</code>
    field, add a brief description of what you've done (i.e. "Added
    index items for vol7"). If there is additional information
    you'd like to add, put a longer explanation in the
    <code>Description</code> box.</p>
